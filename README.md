# Document Verifier Project

This project is a Django application designed to convert images of documents, such as Aadhar cards and PAN cards, into text. It verifies the extracted information against a MySQL database and automates the process of verification and data correction. Alerts are sent for admin approval upon detecting errors.

## Features

- Image upload and processing using Tesseract for Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
- Data verification against a MySQL database.
- Automated error detection and correction suggestions.
- Admin alerts for manual approval of corrections.

## Technologies Used

- Django: Web framework for building the application.
- Tesseract: OCR engine for text extraction from images.
- OpenCV: Library for image processing.
- NumPy: Library for numerical operations on images.
- spaCy: NLP library for text validation and correction.
- MySQL: Database for storing user and document information.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
